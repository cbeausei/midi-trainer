Simple web app to discover some music theory concepts with a MIDI conencted keyboard.

I'm developping this app as I'm making progress into learning music theory to get practice and better understanding the relation between music and the physical world :)

Visit https://midi-trainer.com to try it out!

Run the app with:

```
./serve.sh
```
